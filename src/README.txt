Instructions/Information:
There are two solvers included in this file, one for human input and one that automatically runs 
the solver with no input from a person. To run the human solver, uncomment line 333. in final.py The format to 
give the program feedback is particular, but instructions are included in the terminal when the 
program runs. 

The tester solver is likely much more useful for grading/evaluatiing this project. Tp run the tester,
simply run the final.py file.

The other files in this folder include the corpus (the complete word bank for this program), my 
completed report, and WordScores.txt which contains the entire corpus along with a score assigned
to each word based on a combination of the popularity of the whole word and the combined popularity 
of all its letters.
